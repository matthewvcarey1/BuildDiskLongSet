# Build a Disk Based Long Set

A very simple program that reads, the contents of a comma seperated file of numbers and builds a disk based long set from them.

The idea is that we read the output generateLongPrimes executable and we make a disk based long set of them in a file, hopefully on an SSD drive.

Two required arguments, the source and the destination files.

This program is painfully slow to build a very large set of longs.
